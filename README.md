# alarm_clock.io
This is the Alarm clock made by using the vanilla Js.
The project structure is quite straightforward:

index.html: The main HTML file that displays the alarm clock interface.
styles.css: The CSS file responsible for styling the interface.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing all the logic for setting, managing, and triggering alarms.
alarm.mp3: An example alarm sound file.
Customize Alarms
You can easily customize the alarms by editing the alarms array in the script.js file. Each alarm is represented by an object with the following properties:

hour: The hour (24-hour format) at which the alarm should trigger.
minute: The minute at which the alarm should trigger.
message: The message to be displayed when the alarm triggers.
sound: The path to the sound file to be played when the alarm triggers.
Feel free to modify this array to add, remove, or adjust alarms to suit your needs.
